## General info
It's a simple application for planning dinner schedule. You can add your recipes and make a weekly meal`s plan. Everything is saved in Local Storage so 
you can always come back to your meals and plans, change them and use whenever you want.

This was a Project dedicated to ScrumLab front-end project in CodersLab. Our Project Team made this project in one Sprint (1 week).   
It was a final Project in Scrum Workshop. That was great simulation of working in Scrum. It gave me a lot of experience.

Especially in:
 1. Working in Scrum
 2. Using Local Storage
 3. Using Sass with Gulp Tool

## Setup

How to start:

To start development follow this instruction:

* `clone` this repo
* `npm install` all necessary npm packages


Gulp usage:
Available commends for you to type in console:

`npm run watch` - runs gulp in watch mode, that will compiles your `main.scss` into `css/main.css` and run the server.

`gulp` or `gulp serve`  - this will run gulp in browserSync mode, that means gulp will start serwer on your `localhost` and refresh it for you everytime you change `scss`, `js` or `html` file. Using this command will do all the work for you :)

`gulp sass` - compiles sass into CSS & auto-inject into browsers
